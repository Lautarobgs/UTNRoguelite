In the current project, the team designed and developed a Roguelite-style game using Java and the libGdx framework, which specializes in game logic control, particularly in the utilization of graphic textures and sound effects.

How to Play: <br />
After launching the game and selecting a player name, use the WASD keys for movement and the arrow keys to shoot.<br />
The objective of the game is to defeat the enemies in the room, obtain items that enhance your stats, and proceed to the next level with increased difficulty.<br />
After defeating enemies, the player's score will be added to the Top 10 Highscores on their computer.<br />
